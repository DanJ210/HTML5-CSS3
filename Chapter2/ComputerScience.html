            While the computing field is one of the fastest growing segments of industry, \
            it is also one of the fastest changing areas technologically. Computing professionals 
            education does not stop with the college degree, but continues with seminars, conferences,
             and advanced courses and training. In computer theory and applications, new ideas are 
            developed every day. Success requires an ongoing commitment to learning to maintain knowledge, 
            skills and career opportunities.
           
            Daytona State College is the perfect place to start preparing for a career in the computer 
            science and information technology fields. With more than a dozen programs from which to choose,
             you can be sure to get started on the right track.

            Most programs also are transferable, allowing you to advance your studies to higher levels, 
            including the Daytona State College Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology, which you
             can earn in only two years after completing your associate of science degree. Daytona State 
            College also has articulation agreements with other four-year institutions that will apply 
            your AS degree credits toward a bachelor’s degree.

            <h3 style="text-align:left">Gainful Employment Information</h3>
            The U.S. Department of Education requires colleges to disclose a variety of information for 
            any financial aid eligible program that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized
             occupation. The information provided here describes the graduation rates, the median debt of 
            students who completed the program and other important information regarding gainful employment 
            for the latest completed academic year (as of July 1).
