                I have worked various retail positions with the
                first few starting as standard help while the last
                few were great management positions. Led a couple small
                teams to increase performance out of everyone and
                generated a better working environment for all. I've
                worked with automobiles, retail, business, gaming locations,
                event coordinations, window blind installations in homes,
                even training/teaching. Customer service is probably the
                area that shines brightest when it comes to performance
                and skill enhancements as to me it is one of my top three
                best skills.

                One major new addition is my endevours in programming
                computer skills have always been my most natural and
                passionate skills where programming has always been
                something I've been familiar with. Only the recent year
                I've been able to pursue this dream learning four
                languages in that year with two more being added to that
                before the end of 2016 and much practice and excersize
                in between with the languages to reinforce those skills.
